    "question": "Which hypoxia type is least responsive to oxygen therapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypoventilation",
      "B": "Right-to-left cardiac shunt",
      "C": "High altitude",
      "D": "VA:Q mismatch",
      "E": "Diffusion defect"

    "question": "Which shift occurs in the oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve at extreme altitude?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Right shift due to 2,3-BPG",
      "B": "Left shift due to alkalosis",
      "C": "No shift occurs",
      "D": "Right shift due to hypercapnia",
      "E": "Left shift due to acidosis"

    "question": "What does a low arteriovenous oxygen difference indicate in histotoxic hypoxia?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased oxygen delivery",
