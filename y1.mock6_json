        "options": {
            "A": "Palpation → Inspection → Auscultation → Percussion",
            "B": "Inspection → Palpation → Percussion → Auscultation",

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The correct order is Inspection, Palpation, Percussion, then Auscultation; placing auscultation before palpation and percussion reverses the standard approach."
